# Brick-and-Ball-Game
The brick and ball game is one of the earliest arcade video games, first released in 1976 by Atari. It was derived from the game Pong (released by Atari in 1972). This one-player game features simple 2D graphics. It consists of one paddle (in more recent version the paddle was replaced by a spaceship) used to return a bouncing ball back and forth across the screen. 
The aim of the game is to break the bricks of a brick wall by getting the ball to hit/bounce on the bricks. The score correspond to the number of bricks being hit.
Here we use the conditional statements to run the game 
the concept of classes is also used where we have used the __ init__ method which is similar to the constructor method in other programming languages. This method is invoked automatically when theobject of a class is created.
The argument self is a reference to the current object. That is, it is reference to the object which invoked the method.
To run the game download it from the repository and run the game.
Press the space button to start the game and the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.
